\begin{abstract}
In this work, we  evaluate an asynchronous population-based 
algorithm following a pool-based approach. In Pool-based 
algorithms a collection of heterogeneous workers 
collaborate through a shared population repository. In particular,
we followed the EvoSpace approach in which workers 
asynchronously interact with a population pool by taking 
samples of the population to perform a standard search on the 
samples, to then return newly evolved solutions back to the 
pool. For this porpuse, we use the BBOB noiseless testbed and a 
hybrid algorithm mixing two kinds or workers:  PSO  and GA. 
We find that an Pool-based approach outperforms
the canonical GA and PSO algorithms in nearly all cases. 
The results from these tests suggest that a Pool Based approach 
can be used to implment hybrid algorithms that can improve 
the performance of canonical population-based optimization algorithms.

\section{Introduction}
Asynchronous EAs \cite{Jini:FEA2000,alba2001analyzing,Jini:FEA2000,jj:2008:PPSN} have
started to become common only relatively recently, in an effort to 
exploit computing resources available through different Internet technologies,
including cloud and volunteer-based. In this work, we are
interested in benchmarking asynchronous EAs following a pool-based 
approach, we will refer to such algorithms as {\em Pool-based EAs} 
or PEAs, and highlight the fact that such systems are 
intrinsically parallel, distributed and asynchronous.

Pool-EAs differ from the closely related Island Model, 
mainly with regards to the responsibilities assigned to 
the server. When there is a server in the island model, it is 
responsible for the interaction and synchronization of 
all the populations.  In Pool-EAs, on the other hand, the population repository only 
receives stateless requests from isolated workers 
or clients. In this way, Pool-EAs are capable of using and leveraging an 
ad-hoc and ephemeral collaboration of computing resources. 

The algorithm presented in this paper follows the basic 
EvoSpace model \cite{GValdez2015} in which EvoWorkers 
asynchronously interact with the population pool by 
taking samples of the population to perform a standard 
evolutionary search on the samples, to then return newly
evolved solutions back to the pool. This is a
particular instance of a Pool-based EA, which, as long as there is a
common population pool, leaves every other detail to particular
implementations. 

To test this PEA against the Noiseless BBOB testbed, 
we mixed two canonical versions of the GA and PSO algorithms, 
by just defining EvoWorkers of each kind. The performance 
%reported 
%although not achieving an outstanding performance when compared 
%against the leading algorithms, the results 
obtained highlight 
that a Pool Based approach can be used to improve the performance 
of single population-based optimization algorithms.

\section{Algorithm Presentation}

As we mentioned earlier, EvoWorkers are independent of 
the population repository, and developers can implement them 
in any language that supports HTTP requests. In this work,  
EvoWorkers were implemented in Python taking advantage of 
two open source libraries of nature inspired optimization 
metaheuristics:  DEAP \cite{fortin2012deap} and EvoloPy 
\cite{faris2016evolopy}. For each algorithm a 
python script was responsible for the initialization using 
the required parameters and setting up the initial population, 
then after some iterations, the current population and 
benchmark data is sent back to the server. The source code 
for the Python EvoWorkers proposed in this work are in 
the following GitHub repository: \url{https://github.com/mariosky/EvoWorker}.
For the porppuse of this work we called this algorithm EvoSpace-PSO-GA.  


%
\section{Experimental Procedure}
A script was responsible for creating the EvoWorker 
containers and running the testbed. The maximum number of 
function evaluations was set to $10^5*D$. For each run 
of the algorithms, the initial solution
$X_0$ is sampled uniformly in $[−5, 5]^D$.
In order to maintain the required number of function 
evaluations the following EvoWorker setup was set for
each dimension (see Table~\ref{tab:params}).

\section{CPU Timing}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% note that the following text is just a proposal and can/should be changed to your needs:
In order to evaluate the CPU timing of the algorithm, we have run the EvoSpace-PSO-GA algorithm 
on the  bbob test suite \cite{hansen2009fun} with no restarts for a maximum budget 
equal to  $10^5*dim$ function evaluations according to \cite{hansen2016exp}. 
The Python (version 2.7.13) code was run on a MacPro (late 2013) Intel(R) Quad Core 
Intel Xeon (TM) E5 CPU @ 3.7GHz with 12 GB 1866 MHz DDR3 ECC RAM, 1 processor and 4 cores, 
EvoWorkers were executed in Docker (v 17.03.0-ce-mac2) container images are available at
\url{https://hub.docker.com/r/mariosky/evo_worker/} . 
% TO DO 
The time per function evaluation for dimensions 2, 3, 5, 10, 20, 40 equals $0.0678$, $0.0676$,
$0.0372$, $0.03929$, $0.03929$, and $0.05223$  miliseconds respectively. 
Times were measured with EvoWorkers executing in parallel on the Docker containers
mentioned above, is important to notice that the number of EvoWorkers increased 
with dimensions (see Table~\ref{tab:params}). 



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Results}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

After the  execution, a script processed the logs and 
generated the files needed by the COCO platform \cite{hansen2016cocoplat}  post-processing scripts. 

A requirement of the COCO platform is that it needs 
to inspect each function evaluation to keep the log required 
to analyze the execution. The logging code maintains 
a sequential record of the number function calls. 

It is not practical to track the exact sequential 
number of function evaluations in an asynchronous 
execution, because many workers could be calling 
the function at the same time. For this reason, the 
granularity of the number of function evaluations and 
their order was kept at the sample and iteration level. 
As we mentioned earlier, each worker returns the number 
of evaluations performed in each iteration. The order 
of function calls was given by the order in which the 
server received the samples and the order of the 
iterations in each. On the other hand, the number of 
function evaluations is incremented in each iteration 
by the sample size and the best function evaluation is 
assigned that number,  as if in each iteration the best 
solution was found in the last function evaluation. Instead 
of incrementing the number by one it is incremented by the 
number of solutions in the sample. 
It is important to notice that EvoWorkers run the algorithm 
only for a small number of iterations and with 
a relatively small sample of the population. For instance,
for the COCO benchmark presented in the case study the maximum number of 
function evaluations in a single iteration was 200.

The COCO post-precessing script currently has an assertion stating
that all the function evaluations start at number 1. In our
case the first evalauation had a number equal to the total number
of evalautions in a single iteration. In order to run the script 
a dummy function evaluation was inserted at the begining. 

Results of \algname\ from experiments according to \cite{hansen2016exp} and \cite{hansen2016perfass} on the benchmark
functions given in \cite{wp200901_2010,hansen2012fun} are presented in
Figures~\ref{fig:aRTgraphs}, \ref{fig:RLDs}, \ref{tab:aRTloss}, and \ref{fig:aRTlogloss} and in
Tables~\ref{tab:aRTs}. The experiments were performed with COCO \cite{hansen2016cocoplat}, version bbob.v15.03 in
python, the plots were produced with version 2.0.

\section{Discussion}  % and or conclusion, summary...
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The results obtained show that an asynchronous execution 
following a Pool-based approach is  possible and easy to achieve.
Results, however, are still preliminary and further tuning of the parameters could 
potentially wield better results.

Future lines of work will focus on using other EA or 
meta-heuristic techniques, such as the Grey Wolf Optimizer \cite{mirjalili2014grey}
or Differential Evolution \cite{storn1997differential} for having workers that are 
heterogeneous in more than one sense. RPSS could be used 
in those cases where each algorithm has a different set of 
parameters, but also to randomly select the technique employed.
