		<section> <!-- Questions -->
		  <h1>What is an evolutionary algorithm?</h1>
		  
		  <aside class='notes'>It's a Nature-inspired algorithm
		    where a set of data structures representing solutions to a
		    problem evolve via individual or collective
		    changes. Please bear in mind that the
		    words <em>loop</em>, or <em>initialization</em> or
		    many other things are not part of this barebones
		    definition. We do need data structures to represent
		    the solutions and a way to "evolve" them. This is the
		    skeleton. The rest needs to be fleshed out to make
		    this become an actual algorithm that can be run. But
		    this begs the question.</aside>
		</section>
		
		<section><h1>Algorithms + data structures =</h1>
		  <h1 class='fragment'>Evolution programs</h1>
		  
		  <aside class='notes'>That definition does not throw
		    the algorithm and the data structure in the same
		    bag. There's data somewhere, there's an algorithm
		    somewhere else. They might be the self same thing, but
		    they could be something completely different. If we
		    use the definition from the famous Michalewicz book,
		    you can have <em>many</em> algorithms. One could be
		    an evolutionary algorithm, another could be a
		    completely different one, like PSO. But the problem
		    is where you run them?</aside>
		</section>
		
		<section><h1>Where do we run algorithms?</h1>
		  <aside class='notes'>If you're an straight shooter,
		    the answer would be "A computer". Maybe you could say
		    "the cloud", which is where you run your programs in
		    the XXIst century. But a more precise answer to the
		    question would be <em>in a technosocial system</em> that
		    includes computers and people who own them and which
		    are, at the same time, connected via a social
		    network. Even if you do not consider the human in the
		    loop, where you run the algorithm is going to be a
		    complex system itself, heterogeneous, with different
		    timelines, different capabilities and budgets. If you
		    want to leverage it fully, you will need to take into
		    account this nature. </aside>

	      <section>
		<section><h1>Population = persistent + ephemeral</h1>
		  <aside class='notes'>Not <em>all</em> the population
		    has to be present <em>all the time</em>. To keep
		    track of the progress of the algorithm, a few
		    select members of the population is quite enough. </aside>
		</section>

		<section><h1>Algorithms = any</h1>
		  <h2 class='fragment'>If there's change and
		    recombination</h2>
		  <aside class='notes'>The zen of genetic algorithms
		  is very general about the mechanisms of change. If
		  there is variability introduced in the population
		  pool, some kind of selection and maybe recombination
		  that is more than enough as long as there is a
		    persistent part of the population updated</aside>
		</section>

		<section><h1>Persistent population
		    → <em>Pool</em></h1>
		  <aside class='notes'>This pool will be an evolving
		  log of the best and the brightest among whatever the
		    rest of the algorithms have found.</aside>
