\begin{abstract}

  In this work, we evaluate an asynchronous population-based
algorithm following a pool-based approach. In Pool-based algorithms, a
collection of workers collaborates through a shared population repository. In
particular, we followed the EvoSpace approach in which workers asynchronously
interact with a population pool by taking samples of the population to perform a
standard search on the samples, to then return newly evolved solutions back to
the pool. For this purpose, we use the BBOB Noiseless Testbed and a hybrid
algorithm combining two kinds or workers:  PSO  and GA. We find that a Pool-
based approach outperforms the canonical GA and PSO algorithms in nearly all
cases. The results of these tests suggest that a Pool Based approach can be used
to implement hybrid algorithms that can improve the performance of canonical
population-based optimization algorithms. \end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
Asynchronous EAs \cite{Jini:FEA2000,alba2001analyzing,jj:2008:PPSN} have
started to become common only relatively recently, in an effort to 
exploit computing resources available through different Internet technologies,
including cloud and volunteer-based. In this work, we are
interested in benchmarking asynchronous EAs following a pool-based 
approach, we will refer to such algorithms as {\em Pool-based EAs} 
or PEAs, and highlight the fact that such systems are 
intrinsically parallel, distributed and asynchronous.


Pool-EAs differ from the closely related Island Model, mainly with regards to
the responsibilities assigned to the server. When there is a server in the
island model, it is responsible for the interaction and synchronization of all
the populations. In Pool-EAs, on the other hand, the population repository only
receives stateless requests from isolated workers or clients. In this way,
Pool-EAs are capable of using and leveraging an ad-hoc and ephemeral
collaboration of computing resources.

The algorithm presented in this paper follows the basic  EvoSpace model
\cite{GValdez2015} in which EvoWorkers  asynchronously interact with the
population pool by taking samples of the population to perform a standard
evolutionary search on the samples, to then return newly evolved solutions back
to the pool. This design is a particular instance of a Pool-based EA, which, as
long as there is a shared population pool leaves every other detail to their
specific implementations.


To test this PEA against the Noiseless BBOB testbed, 
we mixed two canonical versions of the GA and PSO algorithms, 
by just defining EvoWorkers of each kind. The performance 
%reported 
%although not achieving an outstanding performance when compared 
%against the leading algorithms, the results 
obtained highlight 
that a Pool Based approach can be used to improve the performance 
of single population-based optimization algorithms.

\section{Algorithm Presentation}

As we mentioned earlier, EvoWorkers are independent of  the population
repository, and developers can code them  in any language that supports HTTP
requests. In this work,   EvoWorkers were implemented in Python taking
advantage of  two open source libraries of nature inspired optimization
metaheuristics:  DEAP \cite{fortin2012deap} and EvoloPy
\cite{faris2016evolopy}. The EvoSpace population repository is implemented in
Node.js and uses the Redis memory store as the repository. The code is in the
following GitHub repository: \url{https://github.com/mariosky/evospace-js}. 
On the other hand, each EvoWorker runs inside a Docker container. Before each
experiment, a script initializes the population on the server, creating the
number of individuals specified in the {\em Population Size} parameter, this size
depends on the dimension of the problem.  The same script then starts the
number of containers needed, one for each EvoWorker. When starting each
container, the following parameters are used: first, the {\em Sample Size}
indicates the number of individuals the worker would take from the server on each
interaction, then the {\em Iterations per Sample} parameter specifies the number of
generations or iterations the local algorithm will run before sending back to
the server the resulting population. Finally, the number of times an 
EvoWorker will take, evolve and return a sample, is 
indicated by the {\em Samples per Worker} parameter. These
parameters are specified for each of the dimensions, and they give the maximum
number of function evaluations for each problem. Each time an EvoWorker 
returns an evolved sample, it also returns benchmark data, indicating the type
of algorithm and parameters used, the number of function evaluations, 
best individual, and fitness of each iteration. The source code for the Python 
EvoWorkers proposed in this work is in the following GitHub repository:
\url{https://github.com/mariosky/EvoWorker}. 
For the purpose of this work, we called this algorithm EvoSpace-PSO-GA.   


% 
\section{Experimental Procedure} 
A script was responsible for creating the
EvoWorker  containers and running the testbed. The maximum number of  function
evaluations was set to $10^5*D$. For each run  of the algorithms, the initial
solution $X_0$ is sampled uniformly in [-5, 5]$^D$. In order to maintain the
required number of function  evaluations the EvoWorkers were set up as
shown in Table~\ref{tab:params}. The current experiment uses instances 1-5 and 41-50
from the 2016 version of the test bed.

\end{table}


\subsection{Parameter Tuning}

The parameters for each type of EvoWorker are shown in Table \ref{tab:GAparams}
and Table \ref{tab:PSOparams} for GAs and PSO respectively. These parameters 
were obtained by testing first on the Rastrigin separable function with 
five dimensions.  After about fifteen experiments the most challenging 
targets were achieved. We tested again with functions one to three, and 
after obtaining favorable results, the PSO and GA algorithm parameters were set.

\section{CPU Timing}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% note that the following text is just a proposal and can/should be changed to your needs:
In order to evaluate the CPU timing of the algorithm, we have run the EvoSpace-PSO-GA algorithm 
on the  BBOB test suite \cite{hansen2009fun} with no restarts for a maximum budget 
equal to  $10^5*dim$ function evaluations according to \cite{hansen2016exp}. 
The Python (version 2.7.13) code was run on a MacPro (late 2013) Intel(R) Quad Core 
Intel Xeon (TM) E5 CPU @ 3.7GHz with 12 GB 1866 MHz DDR3 ECC RAM, 1 processor and 4 cores, 
EvoWorkers were executed in Docker (v 17.03.0-ce-mac2) container images are available at
\url{https://hub.docker.com/r/mariosky/evo_worker/} . 
% TO DO 
The time per function evaluation for dimensions 2, 3, 5, 10, 20, 40 equals $0.0678$, $0.0676$,
$0.0372$, $0.03929$, $0.03929$, and $0.05223$  milliseconds respectively. 
Times were measured with EvoWorkers executing in parallel on the Docker containers
mentioned above, is important to notice that the number of EvoWorkers increased 
with dimensions (see Table~\ref{tab:params}). 



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Results}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

After the  execution, a script processed the logs and 
generated the files needed by the COCO platform 
\cite{hansen2016cocoplat}  post-processing scripts. 

A requirement of the COCO platform is that it needs 
to inspect each function evaluation to keep the log required 
to analyze the execution. The logging code maintains 
a sequential record of the number function calls. 

It is not practical to track the exact sequential 
number of function evaluations in an asynchronous 
execution, because many workers could be calling 
the function at the same time. For this reason, the 
granularity of the number of function evaluations and 
their order was kept at the sample and iteration level. 
As we mentioned earlier, each worker returns the number 
of evaluations performed in each iteration. The order 
of function calls was given by the order in which the 
server received the samples and the order of the 
iterations in each. On the other hand, the number of 
function evaluations is incremented in each iteration 
by the sample size and the best function evaluation is 
assigned that number,  as if in each iteration the best 
solution was found in the last function evaluation. Instead 
of increasing the number by one it is incremented by the 
number of solutions in the sample. 
It is important to notice that EvoWorkers run the algorithm 
only for a small number of iterations and with 
a relatively small sample of the population. For instance,
for the COCO benchmark presented in the case study the maximum number of 
function evaluations in a single iteration (generation) was 200.

The COCO post-processing script currently has an assertion stating
that all the function evaluations start at number 1. In our
case the first evaluation had a number equal to the total number
of evaluations in a single iteration. In order to run the script 
a function evaluation of a random generated solution was 
inserted at the beginning. Each component of the solution was generated
using the basic random function from the Python standard library. The
random function generates a random float uniformly in the semi-open 
range [0.0, 1.0) using the Mersenne Twister as the core generator.


Results of \algname\ from experiments according to \cite{hansen2016exp} 
and \cite{hansen2016perfass} on the benchmark
functions given in \cite{wp200901_2010,hansen2012fun} are presented in
Figures~\ref{fig:aRTgraphs} and \ref{fig:RLDs} and in Table~\ref{tab:aRTloss}. The experiments were performed with COCO \cite{hansen2016cocoplat}, version bbob.v15.03 in
python, the plots were produced with version 2.0.

\section{Discussion}  % and or conclusion, summary...
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


The results obtained show that the algorithm reaches the most difficult 
targets on separable functions (1-5), and scales well to
higher dimensions, with better-than-linear scaling in most cases and
close to quadratic in some of them. These results are competitive 
when compared to other nature-inspired algorithms \cite{hansen2010bbob}.
In particular when comparing against the Binary GA algorithm implementation 
of Nicolau \cite{nicolau2009application}, and the PSO algorithm by 
El-Abd and Kamel \cite{el2009black}: the EvoSpace-PSO-GA 
algorithms outperforms both, reaching more targets with a lower expected 
running time (ERT). When testing with harder problems, for instance functions 
13 and 24, the algorithm is not capable of reaching the most difficult targets. 

Future lines of work will focus on using other EA or 
meta-heuristic techniques, such as the Grey Wolf Optimizer \cite{mirjalili2014grey}
or Differential Evolution \cite{storn1997differential} for having workers that are 
heterogeneous in more than one sense. RPSS could be used 
in those cases where each algorithm has a different set of 
parameters, but also to randomly select the technique employed.

The experiment shows that an asynchronous execution of population-based optimization algorithms 
following a Pool-based approach is possible and easy to achieve.
Results, however, are still preliminary and further tuning of the parameters could 
potentially yield better results.
